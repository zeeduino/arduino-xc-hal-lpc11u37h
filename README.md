## Zeeduino-XC Hardware Abstraction Layer implementation for LPC11U37H

In order to see initial implementation demo where we implemented only basic board initialization, delay and digital I/O checkout branch **`initial_hal_demo`**.

This HAL is implemented using [LPCXpresso V2 Board for LPC11U37H](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/hardware-development-tools/lpcxpresso-boards/lpcxpresso-board-for-lpc11u37h:OM13074).
